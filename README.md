# Spotify Explorer

This is a command line Spotify client. The application consumes Spotify's REST API to fetch lists of the following
Spotify music items: new album releases, featured playlists, music categories and lastly their playlists.
Correspondingly, supported user input strings (i.e. user commands) include `new`, `featured`, `categories` and, for
example, `playlists Rock`. `Rock` can be replaced by any other category obtained using the `categories` command.

Item lists recieved from Spotify are presented to the user using the standard output. The lists are split into
scrollable "pages" containing a pre-set numer of items per page (default number of items per page = 5, see
application.yml).

## Git Repository and Default Branch Names

I wanted to store my app in a public GitHub repository for easy sharing with reviewers. At the same time, I was
interested in minimizing its searchability through general search. Google isn't expected to index branches other than `master` and `main`, that's why my only branch is called `prime`. I also named the repository itself with a name
that is unrelated to the functionality or purpose of this app.

## System Requirements to Build the Application

- JDK 11+
- Internet Access (for downloading dependencies by Gradle)
- Writable application's directory (for build artifacts)
